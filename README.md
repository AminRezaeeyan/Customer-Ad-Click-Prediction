# Customer Ad Click Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will click on an advertisement using advanced machine learning techniques. With **powerful feature engineering**, **handling missing values and duplicates**, and **support vector machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel**, the model achieves **near-perfect accuracy**. The analysis is backed by **great visualizations** to understand feature distributions and relationships.

## Problem Definition
The goal is to develop a highly accurate model that predicts whether a customer will click on an ad. This helps businesses improve their ad targeting and optimize conversion rates.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains **user demographics, browsing behavior, and ad engagement details**.
- **Duplicates and missing values** are handled effectively to maintain data integrity.
- Feature distributions and correlations are explored using **seaborn and matplotlib visualizations**.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Histograms and correlation heatmaps** provide deep insights into data distribution.
- **Outliers are detected and managed** to prevent skewed model training.
- **Feature relationships are explored** to understand important predictors.

## Feature Engineering
- New **derived features** are created to enhance model performance.
- **Categorical encoding and normalization** techniques are applied.
- **Feature selection techniques** are used to retain the most important predictors.

## Model Selection & Training
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel** is chosen due to its strong generalization ability.
- The model is trained on a well-preprocessed dataset, ensuring **optimal performance**.

## Results & Performance
- The **SVM model with RBF kernel achieves near-perfect accuracy** in predicting ad clicks.
- **Confusion matrices and classification reports** confirm the model's reliability.
- **Great visualizations** illustrate feature importance and decision boundaries.
